# OOP SCHOOL LIBRARY

> this project is built to keep track of the books, members, and rentals at a school library


## Getting Started

You need to have Ruby in you operating system to run the irb terminal.
> if you don't have Ruby installed in your machine, you can follow [this link](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-ruby/blob/main/simple-ruby/articles/ruby_installation_instructions.md
) to find instructions for all operating systems.

* To open the `irb` and play around with the code just type `irb` in your terminal and copy/paste the code into your irb.

* Else, fork a copy to your repository and clone it locally:
> `$ git clone https://github.com/Anjacodes/OOP_school_library.git
$ cd OOP_school_library`

* Now, run the command ruby filename.rb in your terminal to check if solutions are printed correctly.
